# DishDuck
When you are in the middle of nowhere or there are no ClusterDuck networks in your area what do you do?
Well, if you need sensor data or an emergency communications mesh network in that area, then **check out the DishDuck**.

The DishDuck is made up of a modified PAPA Duck with an Iridium Satellite Modem.
The Satellite Modem is called the RockBlock 9603 that allows you to talk to over 75 Iridium Satellites using Short-Burst Data.
With this connection you can almost always send sensor data or even send and receive emergency messages as long as you have a view of the sky.
